          <h1>Tamrias Studio</h1>

          <p>Tamrias is a classically-trained
            electro-acoustic musician and producer
            currently based in Cape Town,
            South Africa.</p>

          <p>Her debut album, titled 'New Leaf' is a deep,
            reflective expedition into the unknown.</p>

          <p>Swirling, cinematic sound-design techniques
            and cut-up glitch-esque electronics swim amidst
            colourful composition, with sampled loops and
            naturally occurring soundscapes.</p>

          <p><small>Released January 18, 2018</small></p>

          <p><small>Mastered by Levi Thole</small></p>
